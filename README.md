# Project 01 – DNA Fusion Simulator

## Objective
To simulate the combination of DNA from two animals and generate a unique DNA
sequence for a hypothetical new species.

## Disclaimer
This project is a **simulation for educational purposes only** and does not represent
real genetic engineering or biological accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit

## How It Works
1. Select two animals
2. DNA is combined base-by-base
3. Random mutation adds uniqueness
4. New DNA sequence is generated

## How to Run
```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py
